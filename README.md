# How_To_Vote

Android app that allows users to see which Presidential candidate most matched their views.

TODO for version 1.0:
improve viewing of quiz results
add way to compare user's answers with a single candidate's answers
save user's results for viewing later / comparing to other saved results
imporve looks of all views
add more information to the meet the candidates views
add popup help on each question which gives info on which answer to choose based on the user's opinion


Other ideas (for beyond 1.0):
add more candidates
add longer quiz with more in-depth questions / more sections
add way to help users actually vote (register / find polling place / notification on election day)
