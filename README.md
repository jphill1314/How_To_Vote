# How_To_Vote

Android app that allows users to see which Presidential candidate most matched their views.

## TODO for version 1.0:

*improve viewing of quiz results
*add way to compare user's answers with a single candidate's answers
*imporve looks of main screen
*imporve looks of card with candidate's party and experience
*add popup help on each question which gives info on which answer to choose based on the user's opinion


## Other ideas (for beyond 1.0):

*save user's results for viewing later / comparing to other saved results
*add more candidates
*add longer quiz with more in-depth questions / more sections
*add way to help users actually vote (register / find polling place / notification on election day)
